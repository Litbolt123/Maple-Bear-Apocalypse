- ✅ **Biome size multipliers** - Large biomes are slightly louder
- ✅ **Immediate start** - Plays immediately on world join if in infected biome
- ✅ **Continuous looping** - Restarts every 100 ticks to maintain playback

**Status:** Complete - Full biome ambience system implemented

**Notes:**
